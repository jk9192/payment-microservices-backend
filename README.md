# Payment Microservices Backend

A backend-focused project exploring microservices architecture using Java and Spring Boot.
The system models a simplified digital payment workflow by dividing responsibilities across independent services.

##  Architecture

* **API Gateway** — routes requests
* **User Service** — manages users
* **Wallet Service** — handles balances
* **Transaction Service** — processes payments
* **Reward Service** — reward logic
* **Notification Service** — notifications

---

##  Technologies Used

* Java
* Spring Boot
* Maven
* Docker / Docker Compose
* REST APIs

---

##  Learning Outcomes

* Structuring backend applications as microservices
* Understanding service boundaries
* API gateway routing
* Multi-module Maven usage
* Containerized deployment

---

##  Running the Project

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

---

##  Future Improvements

* Authentication & authorization
* Monitoring/logging
* Database expansion
* AWS deployment
